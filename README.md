# Recipe Viewer Site

Simple overview of use/purpose.


## My web-site
<https://n-factorial-incubator-alpha.vercel.app/>


### Process

* Site was done using Next.js framework for more comfortability with routing.
* I had immediantly experimented with the API, did pagination by manipulating the API link.
* All data is from the API. No data that is used is static.
* My front-end isn't great so the site isn't fully responsive (the search bar isn't responsive). I made the pagination responsive by changing the limit.

### Site Capabilities

* The loading of the site is fast and uses the server side with the client side.
* You can look through the popular recipes that I acquired with the API, choosing to show more or less.
* The search bar can look for recipes names and find them. Showcased the search results using the scroll feature.
* The components of the site are independent of each other. 


### Compromises

* I wanted to add a list that saves the favourite recipes of each user using LocalStorage. But I wasn't able to in the end. I thought of using MySQL instead of LocalStorage but I had no time.
* I wanted to do the pagination better like using numbers for pages 1, 2, 3, 4, .. In the end, I did it in a simpler way.
